## DLL Mod Support

Mewtator supports DLL-based mods through integration with Mewjector (external DLL chainloader).

**⚠️ Important:** DLL files execute with full system privileges. Only install DLL mods from trusted sources!

**Requirements:**
- **Mewjector (DLL Chainloader):** [Download from Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/218)
- Enable "DLL Mod Support" in Settings → Launch Options

**How it works:**
1. Mewtator detects DLL files in your mods
2. Creates a manifest file listing all DLL paths
3. Updates Mewjector's configuration to load the DLLs
4. Mewjector loads DLLs when the game starts

For mod authors creating DLL mods, see the DLL Mod Security section in [MOD_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md](MOD_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md).

## For Mod Authors

Mewtator supports advanced modding features to help you create better mods.

### Documentation

- **[MOD_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md](MOD_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide on creating mods, including all available `description.json` fields and best practices
- **[MOD_REQUIREMENTS.md](MOD_REQUIREMENTS.md)** - Detailed documentation on the requirements and dependency system

### Quick Example

```json
{
  "title": "My Awesome Mod",
  "author": "YourName",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Does something cool.",
  "requirements": [
    "CoreFramework>=1.5.0"
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The mod's folder name (e.g., `MyMod`) serves as its identifier - not a field in the JSON.

## Using Auto-Sort

Mewtator can automatically arrange your mods in the correct load order based on their requirements.
Currently it sorts alphetically and then applies requirements.  I plan to update this if better logic is needed in the future (like checking for merege conflics or whole file overwrites.)

**How to use:**
- Click "Auto-Sort" button in main window

**Circular dependency detection:**
If ModA requires ModB and ModB requires ModA, you'll see:
```
Circular dependency detected: ModA → ModB → ModA
```
To fix: Remove one of the requirement links so dependencies flow in one direction.

## Building

```bash
pyinstaller Mewtator.spec
